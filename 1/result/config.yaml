# The key components covered include:

# Application Name: Highlighting that spaces in keys are valid without needing quotes.
# Strings: Encouraging the habit of wrapping strings in double quotes, though it's not a syntax requirement.
# Versioning: Recommending the use of floats to represent semantic versions.
# Author and Description: Explaining that strings can optionally be wrapped in quotes.
# Environment Settings: Describing the structure as a map of maps for both development and production environments.
# Database Configuration: Outlining the database as a map containing type, host, port, username, and schema name.
# Logging Configuration: Simple standard logging setup including log files.
# Modules: Explained as a sequence of maps, each with 'name', 'enabled', and 'priority' keys.
