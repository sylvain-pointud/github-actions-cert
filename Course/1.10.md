Workflow Definition: Each workflow is defined by a single YAML file stored in the .github/workflows/ directory of a repository. The file can be named anything with a .yaml extension.

Workflow Properties:

Name: An optional property that specifies the display name of the workflow in the Actions tab. If not defined, the workflow file name is used.
Run-name: Another optional property that sets the name for individual runs of the workflow.
On Property: This defines the events that trigger the workflow. It is a map that can include nested maps for various events like push, pull request, and workflow dispatch.
Branch Filtering: The video discusses using branch filters to trigger workflows only for specific branches, enhancing control over when workflows run.

Manual Triggering: The workflow dispatch event allows for manual triggering of workflows, which is useful for testing.

Debugging: The video emphasizes the importance of testing workflows before deploying them to ensure they function correctly.
