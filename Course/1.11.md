**Jobs**: Each workflow file must contain at least one job, which is defined within the jobs property. Jobs can be named using alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

**Runners**: Each job runs on a dedicated runner, which can be either hosted by GitHub or self-hosted. The runs-on property specifies the operating system and version for the runner, such as ubuntu-latest or ubuntu-20.04.

**Steps**: Jobs consist of steps that are executed sequentially. If any step fails, the job fails unless specified otherwise. The first step often involves checking out the repository using the actions/checkout action, which makes the code available for the job.

**Types of Steps**: Steps can include running shell commands, either as single-line commands or multi-line scripts.

**Execution Order**: The order of steps is crucial, as they run sequentially, and the arrangement can affect the outcome of the job.
